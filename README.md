## Project Overview

The SSP Project is a simple social media web app that I built two years ago using React.js and Node.js. It is similar to Twitter and allows users to:
- Create an account  
- Post, edit, and delete tweets  
- Follow other users  
- View tweets from the people they follow  

The goal was to learn full-stack development and practice working with user data, routing, and basic state management.

## Challenges and Areas for Improvement

While the project functions as expected, I have identified several areas where it could be improved:

1. **Performance**  
   - Tweets can take time to load, especially as more are added.  
   - No lazy loading or pagination is used yet.

2. **Mobile Experience**  
   - The layout is not fully responsive on smaller devices.  
   - Some buttons and text can overlap or appear too small.

3. **User Control**  
   - Users cannot deactivate their account or delete all their data at once.  
   - There is no way to report inappropriate content.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethics is important when building apps that handle user content and data. Here are a few areas I reflected on:

1. **Data Privacy**  
   - The app should give users control over their data.  
   - Users should be able to delete their account and all related data.

2. **Content Responsibility**  
   - In a public posting system, harmful or offensive content is a risk.  
   - A report or flag system could help with moderation.

3. **Fair Usage**  
   - To avoid spam or abuse, the system could include rate limiting or tweet limits.  
   - The app should make clear what data is collected and why.

## Future Plans

If I continue to improve this project, I will:
- Add pagination or infinite scroll for better performance  
- Make the UI more responsive for phones and tablets  
- Add a feature for account deletion and a clear privacy policy  
- Create a basic system for reporting harmful content  
- Limit how often users can post in a short time

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand the technical side of building a web app. Now, I see the importance of thinking about how users experience it and how to protect their rights and safety. These changes will help make the app more professional, fair, and user-friendly.
